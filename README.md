# Comments to Evaluators:

This project is in a work in progress with some feautures still underdeveloped. The program currently lacks support for delegates, generics, events, and subscribers. If these aspects are addressed in the future updates, this will easily enhance the programs purpose.  
# Assignment Specific Topics

The Formula Evaluator is designed to parse and evaluate the given expressions as strings. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The evaluator correctly handles with PEMDAS to ensure the correct outputs. 

The implementation uses two kinds of stacks, one for values and the other for operators. The expression will now tokenize and process the expression and output the correct based on the expression. The evaulator also handles various errors such as division by zero, mismatched parentheses, and when the stack is empty.
