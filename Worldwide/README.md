# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of managing and calculating the data within a grid of entries. It supports the input of numerical values and formulas into the entries, and automatically computes and updates the result based on the expression. The program also handles basic arithmetic operations, while handling exceptions such as division by zero, mismatched parentheses, and when the stack is empty. 

Future extensions may possibily include: Enhanced formula support with even more complex functions and error handling. Enhanced user interface to make it easier to enter data and manage formuals. Additional features such as cell formatting and excel.
